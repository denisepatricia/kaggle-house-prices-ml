# Activity Kaggle House Prices (Machine Learning)

Advanced Regression Techniques database (available at https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data , that we did EDA, Exploratory Data Analysis and Visualization. This dataset is aimed toward solving a regression problem (that is, the target variable takes on a range of continuous values). In this activity, we will use decision trees, K-nearest neighbors, Random Forest, and gradient boosting algorithms to train individual regressors on the data. Then, we will build a stacked linear regression model that uses all these algorithms and compare the performance of each. We will use the mean absolute error (MAE) as the evaluation metric for this activity.
